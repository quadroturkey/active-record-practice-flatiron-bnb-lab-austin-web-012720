Intro

This is our first project at Flatiron School. We are required to use an SQL database, an API, and at least one has-many through relationship. We decided to create a sports betting app, which we dubbed 'Big Money Sports.'  Written in Ruby with an SQL database, this is our project.

What is Big Money Sports?

The program is meant to allow users to make bets on real sporting events, using real data coming in from an API. Each user is created with a fake balance, and they are able to see upcoming games and odds, and place a bet. Once the bet is placed the user is able to edit or cancel their bet up until the start time of the game. Bets are payed out upon conclusion of the game and the user will be able to see the results next time the log in to the game.
